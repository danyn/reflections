When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   Anytime you want a backup that you can access in a server that is well managed or you need to colloborate with others using remotes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It allows you to update the refs and see what is going on in the remote before executing git pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are analogous to clones that exist solely on github and automatically attribute the owner of the repository
    clones are copies of a repository and its commit history. 
    branches are basically named commits that you can switch between diverge at and merge together

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will allow you to run meaningful diffs on the files and to keep track of the actuall
    changes that are in the files instead of just knowing that your version is behind by n commits
    if you ran git remote update.  This is by using git fetch instead.
