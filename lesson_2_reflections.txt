What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created.  You need to do this so that git can use that folder to store your states, branches, and commit history


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the files that are in the git repository whether tracked or not and whether changes to those files have
been commited or not.

The staging area allows you to add untracked files, and changes from the working directory to tracked files that get 
commited to the git repository to form version controll file history.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You could only add files or changes to those files to the staging area in groups which form a logical commit.  Then the git repository
will slowly expose the working directory into a series of logical commits that show those changes over time and logical groups.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
